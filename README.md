### Our Philosophy

 - **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to interact with the Linkgear blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
 - **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ligear & Tokens without additional cost.
 - **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
 - **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about Linkgear, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Linkgear and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
 - **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
 - **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
 - **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
 - **Open source & audit-able**
